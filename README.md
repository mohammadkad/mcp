ðŸ§± High-Level MCP Architecture Overview

MCP follows a client-server model, where:
- MCP Hosts run the AI models
- MCP Clients initiate requests
- MCP Servers serve context, tools, and capabilities

Key Components:
- Resources â€“ Static or dynamic data for models
- Prompts â€“ Predefined workflows for guided generation
- Tools â€“ Executable functions like search, calculations
- Sampling â€“ Agentic behavior via recursive interactions
